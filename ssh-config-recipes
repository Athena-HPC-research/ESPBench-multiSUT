# do this in all VMs(save in the default file path and leave the password empty)
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
# dont know if this is needed but i did it
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
# for each VM run visudo and add this line in the file:(yes it is unsafe, we aint in production)
# this is just a line to be added on the /etc/sudoers file
username ALL=(ALL) ALL

# to be able to connect to different machines this is needed: (it will ask for the password of the user at the remote machine, only once for the setup)
# get ip from ifconfig, check that ping IP works and then go ahead and do the following
ssh-copy-id benchmarker@IP 
# to test run:, it should not need a password
ssh benchmarker@IP
# VM 3 done
